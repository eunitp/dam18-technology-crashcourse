# Assignment: Decision making

Task:

- Clients complain that the searches for a destinations sometimes fail. 
Head of product decided to address the issue, and ask development team to work on fix. 

- The team committed to work out the solution during August. 
It was agreed that the teamâ€™s bonus payout would depend on effectiveness of the solution.       

- **The Head of Product ask you to analyze the data and 
help him to decide whether the team deserve the bonus?**

- Your answer should be documented and submitted 
to the GitHub so that any changes can be easily tracked.


Useful context:

- Data for Barcelona destination *(18452212)* is representative, 
so that any conclusions can be extrapolated for other destinations.

##Answer
The answer is YES.

I've compared the 2 data sets of August and September, calculating the mean (average) of error queries of the month resulting:

* Error mean August: 4,539357571
* Error mean September: 3,77 

Error queries have reduced -16%, therefore the team deserves the bonus.
